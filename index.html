    <h1> As The Circle City Turns!</h1>

    <p class="article"> I’ve seen DJs, around the globe from Asia,  to Europe, to the United States. I’ve come in contact with the best that the culture has to offer.  But of all the places I’ve been and all the plate spinners I’ve met the turntable DJs of <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis" class="link-indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, Indiana and the culture they’ve built stand out as uniquely strong. </p> <br><br>

    <p class="article"> A few years ago, I would have said that if you’ve seen any place in the Midwest, you’ve seen Indiana; if you’ve been to any Midwestern city, you’ve been to Indianapolis.  And if you’re used to mountains or water where you’re from, you’ll probably notice the flatness. From a downtown skyscraper  it seems like the nondescript neighborhoods extend all the way to, and probably over, the horizon in all directions, like the farms starting at the edge of town actually do. Even its nicknames — The Circle City, Naptown — are pretty Midwestern and non descript. </p><br><br>
    
    <p class="article">But that’s not true anymore. I mean, it’s still flat — but then, so is a record. And just like a record, Indianapolis is a a place you’ve got to get down into. In a record, you find the magic down in the grooves, in the deep cuts of it's rhythms and synchopation. In Indy, you find it along the green stretches that weave their way through the urban landscape, under the thick tree cover, in neighborhoods all over the city.  </P><br><br>
  
  
  <p class="article">
  On any given day or night you can find one of these hubs in the city bustling with life, color, and culture.  From college kids hanging out in Broad Ripple, to the nightlife and big-event crowds that take over the city’s center at night. Unlike other major Rust Belt cities, Nap-town has been steady economically and is currently seeing an actual growth. Population wise, only Chicago tops it in the region. </P><br><br>

<p class="article">
In the midst of all that is Indianapolis, turntablist turn tables. Just about every night somewhere in this successful metropolis you can find a purveyor of tunes, setting a mood, moving a crowd, or simply driving people into a frenzy of excitement and escape. The interesting and exciting thing about the DJ scene in Indianapolis is that there is a loyalty to the use of turntables that exceeds the norm in other places I’ve been to. Sure, you might run into the occasional CDJ or controller jockey but unlike other cities and other groups of DJs, vinyl and needles rule in the Circle City. The talent and dedication of the DJs in the Indianapolis area to the culture and their craft is second to none also.  </P><br><br>

<p class="article">
  This culture rests on a connection between the architects of the local scene and their Padawans, and it’s rooted in the city itself. Old Skool vinyl enthusiasts like DJ Topspeed, DJ Indiana Jones, Hugh Jeffner, Slater Hogan , and John Larner  laid the foundation thirty- some- odd years ago. The old heads are still active in the scene, even as they’ve been teaching and sharing their art with anyone willing to learn. It’s created  an atmosphere where DJ’s consciously share and pass down the art form to younger DJs that are willing to learn. 
  
  </P><br><br>

  

<p class="article">
  Beyond the camaraderie there is this competiveness that exist. Indianapolis DJs want to be known as the best just like anywhere else. In Nap though, being on top is more about skill than notoriety. Skill is measured in how tight your sets are (the way you choose and play your records), and how that set moves a crowd.  According to Gabby Love , "Naptown isn’t a large market night life city like other places such as, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, or Las Vegas.   People tend to be a little more self-conscious about dancing in the Circle City than in the aforementioned nightlife hubs. As a result DJs have had to work much harder to curate dance floors over the years.  Much more so than other DJs in bigger markets so the attention and time put into solid turntablism is much more prevalent amongst DJs here."

  Indianapolis, Indiana is a special place with some special DJ’s. They love their turntables and they love their legacies. They are true to their craft, they grind hard, they remember their roots, they help, share, teach, and support each other.  Simply put, they stick together and turntables are their glue.

          summer for their summer series on Sundays once a month.
